<h2>From sea to shining sea: The Fish is America’s great environmental victory.</h2>

<h3>by Alexandra Ossola</h3>

<p>Greenhouse gases, sea level rise, energy crisis, factory&#45;raised meat, deforestation, oil spills, the dead zone in the Gulf &#45; man, we&#8217;ve really messed up the environment. That&#8217;s what a lot of news-savvy Americans tend to think. We&#8217;re still figuring out what damage is irreparable and what parts can still be salvaged. Climate change is further complicating the issue in ways that we can&#8217;t fully understand quite yet. But in the face of all this gloom, there’s a scaly, smelly glimmer of hope: the fish.</p>

<p>For over a century, American oceans were drastically overfished. &quot;TK quote about how terrible things were,&quot; says outside source.</p>

<p>Starting in 1997, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) starting tracking the status of fish populations with the help of various research institutions and fisheries. What they found was somewhat startling: not only were the vast majority of fish populations overfished, but there were significant regional differences between the east and west coasts.</p>

<p>In 2005, NOAA started assigning a number to each fish stock, or group of one species that is considered reproductively independent, to indicate its overall health. That number is called a <a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/fisheries_eco/status_of_fisheries/fssi.html">Fish Stock Sustainability Index (FSSI)</a>. NOAA issues different point values (or, in some cases, half a point) depending on how much the population is being overfished and how much NOAA knows about its status. Generally, if a stock has a higher FSSI number, it is in healthier shape and less subject to overfishing. With collaboration from different research institutions from all over the country, NOAA issues the reports quarterly.</p>

<p>Armed with the FSSI, NOAA could start to set <a href="http://www.fpir.noaa.gov/SFD/SFD_regs_3.html">catch limits</a> for how much of each fish stock could be caught per year, measured by weight. Previous attempts to limit fishermen’s opportunity to fish didn’t reduce how much they were fishing, says Karen Greene, a representative from NOAA’s Office of Sustainable Fisheries. NOAA’s efforts paid off—since 2000, the overall FSSI score has almost doubled.</p>

HERE IS GRAPH 1 OVERALL FSSI

<p>The science that goes into setting a stock&#8217;s catch limit is complex, stemming from regional history and culture. &quot;You have to approach [the limits] scientifically—what can the environment support?&quot; says Greene. Researchers in the past few decades have toiled to determine how to keep fish populations sustainable—just how many fish can be removed in order to the stock to regenerate at a stable rate. In this regard, the West Coast and Alaska have been much more successful than the East Coast. &quot;On the West Coast they’ve…chosen to have catch limits in place for a long time,&quot; Greene says. &quot;They have highly productive fisheries there, they don&#8217;t have chronic overfishing problem like in New England.&quot; Kristan Blackhart, also of NOAA, agrees, attesting the region’s success to the directors&#8217; focus on streamlining the stock assessment process and reducing bureaucratic excesses.</p>

<p>Since the East Coast stocks have been overfished for longer, that&#8217;s where the most dramatic changes have occurred. Take, for example the <a href="http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/sos/spsyn/og/hake/">White Hake</a>, which lives mostly off the coast of New England.</p>

<p>TK explanation of my kickass graph. But in part the amount of hake the fishermen caught varies so widely because it&#8217;s so darn confusing to set those catch limits. If the line of the fish population is stable, Greene says, &quot;a lot of times that’s an indicator that the stock is doing okay.&quot; But these initial numbers are still &quot;a very crude tool&quot; to understand how much a stock is being overfished. As NOAA has tinkered with its catch limits over time, the hake has slowly begun to regenerate.   And these populations gain momentum as they rebuild; &quot;TK quote about more reproductive fish leads to faster regeneration.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite many success stories in the Atlantic, some fish stocks, such as the Atlantic Blue Marlin, are still low in number. </p>

<p>In fact, not only are they low in number, but their populations are actually decreasing. TK explanation of my kickass graph. TK explanation for why that’s the case. This is not common.</p>

<p>WHAT PERCENT OF FISH ARE LOOKING GOOD FOR Q4 2013</p>

<p>As fish stocks continue to rebuild, the FSSI scores won&#8217;t necessarily show it. &quot;The trend line is really going to start flattening out,&quot; Green says. As NOAA continues to fine&#45;tune the catch limits for the stocks that are still being overfished, FSSI scores will rise to their maximum. The improvement may not be as much now as in the past, Greene says, but the overall stocks will be healthier. </p>
