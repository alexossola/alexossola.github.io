<h2>Pitch 1: International Boozin'</h2>

<p>When a person travels to a new country, there are a lot of elements of culture to consider: Do the locals speak my language? Is dinner served at 10 PM? Should I dress more or less conservatively? But another important element of culture is alcohol consumption--not just the frequency with which the citizens imbibe, but also the type of liquor they prefer. Where cultural reach surpasses international borders, some alcoholic affinities can give insights into some countries' subtle similarities, and maybe even hearken back to a colonial period. Here's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_liquors">list of national liquors</a> by country (not all countries are listed), which I could use as my raw data. Visually, I would like to start with a base of a world map. I could envision each country being covered with a label for a particular type of alcohol, like they do in <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/map-americas-favorite-beers-by-state-2013-10">this map</a>. The only issue is that each country has a different brand of alcohol, so I would probably just have to pick one. Another cool way to imagine it (and, frankly, the way I prefer) is to fill in the borders of each country with a close-up of the type of liquid-- so, Australia, for example, would just look like you're staring into a <a href="http://cdn.redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/08/CloseUpBeer.jpg">pint of beer</a>. This gets complicated with something like <a href="http://www.latinpost.com/articles/4581/20131210/colombian-aguardiente-aguardiente-la-navidad-navidad-christmas-latin-christmas.htm">aguardiente</a>, which is clear. I'd also like to have little facts when you hover your mouse over each country, like the name of the national liquor and its most popular brand. But I think it could be cool.</p>
