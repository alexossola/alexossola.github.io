<h1>From sea to shining sea: The Fish is America’s great environmental victory.</h1>

<h2>by Alexandra Ossola</h2>

<p>Greenhouse gases, sea level rise, energy crisis, factory-raised meat, deforestation, oil spills, the dead zone in the Gulf—man, we’ve really messed up the environment. That’s what a lot of news-savvy Americans tend to think. We’re still figuring out what damage is irreparable and what parts can still be salvaged. Climate change is further complicating the issue in ways that we can’t fully understand quite yet. But in the face of all this gloom, there’s a scaly, smelly glimmer of hope: the fish.</p>

<p>For over a century, American oceans were drastically overfished. &quot;TK quote about how terrible things were,&quot; says outside source.</p>

<p>Starting in 1997, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) starting tracking the status of fish populations with the help of various research institutions and fisheries. What they found was somewhat startling: not only were the vast majority of fish populations overfished, but there were significant regional differences between the east and west coasts.</p>

<p>In 2005, NOAA started assigning a number to each fish stock, or group of one species that is considered reproductively independent, to indicate its overall health. That number is called a <a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/fisheries_eco/status_of_fisheries/fssi.html">Fish Stock Sustainability Index (FSSI)</a>. NOAA issues different point values (or, in some cases, half a point) depending on how much the population is being overfished and how much NOAA knows about its status. Generally, if a stock has a higher FSSI number, it is in healthier shape and less subject to overfishing. With collaboration from different research institutions from all over the country, NOAA issues the reports quarterly.</p>

<p>Armed with the FSSI, NOAA could start to set <a href="http://www.fpir.noaa.gov/SFD/SFD_regs_3.html">catch limits</a> for how much of each fish stock could be caught per year, measured by weight. Previous attempts to limit fishermen’s opportunity to fish didn’t reduce how much they were fishing, says Karen Greene, a representative from NOAA’s Office of Sustainable Fisheries. NOAA’s efforts paid off—since 2000, the overall FSSI score has almost doubled.</p>
